I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at the SENAC University Center. 📚
I have technical training in Fullstack by PROA Institute through the ProProfissão 4.0 course. 🥳 
I'm a great Technology enthusiast and I am always seeking to learn more about this universe that fascinates me so much. ❤️
In my free time, I like to play games, stay in Discord call with my friends and learn new recipes to cook (Gatronomy also has a place in my heart 👩🏼‍🍳).
I hope you like my profile, feel at home. 😁
